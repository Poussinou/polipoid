Manual regression test
======================
On Android v2.3.3 and latest, check the following:
* Start/stop polipo, check that the binary starts (using ps).
* Check the start on boot toggle works.
* Check the crash handler by killing the polipo wrapper/binary using the shell's kill command.
* Try putting android into a low memory condition (using fill_mem), and check that polipo gets sent the reduce memory signal.
* Toggle the wifi and check that polipo is swapped in and out of offline mode.

* Input a non valid settings file, check the error message.
* Check a valid settings file can be saved.
* Check you can reset the config, and open up the manual.
* Check polipo uses saved confid. proxyName=changed, and http://localhost:8123/arst is a good test.

* Try clearing the polipo cache and selecting 'show polipo log' from the main activity menu. You should see an appropriate dialog.
* Start polipo and then show the log, you should be able to view it in a text viewer application (e.g. 'Text Edit' from Fdroid).

* Check you can start polipo on both an Arm and an x86 device.
